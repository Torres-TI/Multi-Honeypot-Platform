# üõ°Ô∏è Honeypot Deployment on Azure (T-Pot Community Edition)

## What is the purpose of a honeypot?
A honeypot is a deliberately vulnerable or exposed machine or service, with the goal of:
 - Attracting attackers (both humans and bots)
 - Monitoring techniques, tools, and behaviors
 - Collecting logs and indicators of compromise (IoCs)
 - Gaining threat intelligence
Testing responses and defenses without risking real systems.

## Create and Configure Azure Virtual Machine

1. Connect to your **Microsoft Azure** account.
2. Start a new **Virtual Machine**:
    - OS: **Ubuntu (latest version)**
    - Disk: **256 GB**
    - RAM: **16 GB minimum**
3. Choose **‚ÄúPassword‚Äù** as the authentication type.
4. Create a **new Resource Group**.
5. Start the VM.
6. Add a new **Inbound Port Rule**:
    - Allow traffic on **port 6435** (for the T-Pot web UI).

---

## Access and Prepare the VM

1. Connect to the VM using **SSH**:
    - You can use **PuTTY** on Windows or terminal on Linux/macOS.
2. Update the system:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```
    
3. Install Git:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install git -y
    ```
    
4. Now, clone the T-Pot repository and navigate into the directory:

```jsx
git clone https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce
cd tpotce
```

1. Start the installation script: 

```jsx
sudo ./install.sh
```

When prompted, choose the letter **H** to install the **Hive** configuration of T-Pot.

During installation, you'll be asked to set a username and password for accessing the T-Pot web interface. After the installation is complete, reboot the VM.

To access your honeypot dashboard, open a browser and navigate to:

```jsx
https://<your_vm_public_ip>:64297 
```

You can use T-pot for a lot of purposes like monitoring, scan the attackers and understand what kind of attacks is happening right now.

## Attack Map
Here you can see all the attackers, location and types in real time.

## Kibana
Here you have dashboards with all the informations about the attackers.

Also you can see informations like the CVEs, IPs and AS/N

You have a lot of different dashboards available for you and thats awesome. I recommend to you build Honeypots will make your life a lot of more easy and you will be able to explore the most commons attacks and learn how to protect.

## Microsoft Azure Cloud
Here you see how your VMs looks like in Azure Cloud and the cost of this machines for this honeypot is around $80 mo.
